I'm a passionate and dedicated **Front-End Developer** who enjoys building modern, responsive, and user-centric websites using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. My journey in web development started with curiosity, but quickly turned into a deep passion for crafting clean, efficient, and aesthetically pleasing digital experiences.

Over the past year, I’ve not only learned how to code but also how to listen — to understand what users need and what clients envision. I focus on turning ideas into reality, ensuring that every website I build is intuitive, accessible, and impactful.
